     <h2>
       Here are some advantages of advanced technology</h2>
      <h2>Quick access to information.</h2> 
     <p>
       Democratising access to information is undoubtedly one of the greatest advantages of technology.
       Today, some 6.3 million searches are conducted per minute on Google, a staggering fact that
       demonstrates the great thirst for knowledge out there, and which can be satisfied using smartphones
       that are able to access the internet from anywhere.
     </p>
<h2>Facilitated learning.</h2>
     <p>
       Some 49% of students worldwide stated that they had taken an online course in the last 12 months.
       The ease of access to online learning lets anyone train in anything they like without leaving their home.
Moreover, according to a study conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, 90% of leaders in the education sector
       say that students are more imaginative and creative thanks to technology, as well as 80% more productive.
     </p>
<h2>Breaking the distance barrier.</h2>
     <p>
       That technology has revolutionised the way we communicate is undeniable. A case in point is that,      
       during the Covid-19 lockdowns, in Spain alone, 8 out of every 10 citizens between 18 and 65 years old        
       (79.53%) relied on video calls as a way to stay in touch with friends and family. A clear example of how
       technology has broken down distance barriers.
     </p>
<h2>Simplifying tasks.</h2>
     <p>
       Technology turns tedious or complex tasks into interesting and simple ones.
       What's more, in recent years, automation and artificial intelligence have simplified 
       tasks even further, making our day-to-day life easier. One simple example are robot vacuum cleaners, 
       which are able to independently get on with cleaning our homes. 
     </p>
<h2>Providing entertainment.</h2>
     <p>
       Another advantage offered by technology is the ease with which we can access all manner of multimedia 
       content designed for entertainment. Today, video and audio streaming makes up 70% of internet traffic,
       a figure that proves that the internet is one of the main sources of entertainment in the 21st century.  
     </p>
<h2>Increased productivity and efficiency.</h2>
     <p>
       Modern technology boosts productivity as well as the efficiency of human activities, 
       as it allows us to perform tasks in less time. Meanwhile, thanks to the huge amount of
       information available, better decisions can be made, and human error reduced.
     </p>
<h2>Increased life expectancy.</h2>
     <p>
       Technology applied to medicine and healthcare has increased our life expectancy.
       According to data from the United Nations (UN), life expectancy in the 60s was 52.5 years
       while today, the average is 72. The Covid-19 vaccine is undoubtedly a good example of an 
       advantage of technology, given that, for example, in the United States it prevented 140,000 deaths
       and 3 million infections, a true milestone for science. 
     </p>
<h2>Creating new jobs.</h2>
     <p>
       Despite what many people think, technology actually creates more jobs than it destroys. 
       In the so-called fourth industrial revolution and by 2025, technology will have created over 
       97 million jobs around the world. Additionally, these new jobs will be more fulfilling for humans,
       as automation takes over the most boring or repetitive work, freeing humans to be more creative and innovative.
