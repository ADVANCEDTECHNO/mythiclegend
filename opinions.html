     <h2> Here are my opinions on the advanced and future technology.</h2>
     <p>
       The technology is gonna e very useful as robots and other new things will
       make our lives easier as doing tasks that takes patience and precision,we know
       that robots will never make mistakes only do as their told whereaes some
       robots will be made to think like humans and look loike humans making them superhumans
       as their bodies are much more durable than are own and to think faster than humans so 
       basically they are better than us.

     <h2> The people's feelings about robots</h2>
     <p>
       It is but obvious that robots are playing an increasingly critical role
       in the lives of people.

One finds robots in manufacturing, in serving people in restaurants, as receptionists, as nurses, as firefighters and even as soldiers. As we all know, not all robots look like humans (i.e. they are not humanoids). And hence we often tend to miss out the robots that have slowly but surely penetrated into almost every aspect of our lives.

So why are we discussing robotics now? Robotics has reached a level where a combination of technologies will make the robotics industry explode in the near future. We have artificial intelligence combining with speech technologies, combining with sensors and all-pervasive connectivity, leading to more powerful and more useful robots getting created. We do not even realize that an autonomous vehicle (i.e. a self-driving vehicle) is nothing but a robot, in which we will be sitting and getting transported.
